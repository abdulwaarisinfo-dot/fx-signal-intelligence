FLINTEL v9.12 — Reddit (SERP Discovery decoupled from Reddit fetch via a
                NEW flintel_google_posts collection + Python auto-fuzzy
                keyword generation/filtering)
                + Twitter/X Signal Scorer
================================================================================= 
Platforms : Reddit — RapidAPI SERP discovery (Google search, site:reddit.com,
            real per-post rank) -> NEW flintel_google_posts collection ->
            SEPARATE Reddit-fetch loop (public per-post RSS feed, smart-retry,
            no credentials required, fuzzy-keyword content filter)
          + Twitter (tweepy v2)

=================================================================================
WHAT CHANGED IN THIS BUILD (v9.12) — REDDIT FETCHING IS NOW FULLY DECOUPLED
FROM GOOGLE SERP DISCOVERY VIA A NEW COLLECTION. flintel_keywords AND ALL
GOOGLE-RANK / SERP CODE (search_google_for_keyword, fetch_google_rank,
fetch_search_volume, fetch_google_stats, _dig_value, _dig_list,
sync_keywords_to_db, get_due_keywords, get_keywords_missing_volume,
mark_keyword_fetched, set_keyword_retry_cooldown, seed_search_volume_batch)
ARE 100% UNTOUCHED — BYTE-FOR-BYTE IDENTICAL TO v9.11.1.
=================================================================================

  PROBLEM BEING FIXED — in v9.11.1, one keyword's SERP discovery
    (search_google_for_keyword) and that SAME keyword's Reddit RSS
    fetching (fetch_reddit_post_by_url, for every result) happened
    back-to-back inside process_one_keyword(), in the same pass, on the
    same thread. That meant: a keyword was only marked fetched=True
    (finished) once EVERY one of its Reddit posts had also been fetched
    — so a slow/flaky Reddit fetch for one keyword's posts could stall
    or distort that keyword's whole discovery cycle, and Google SERP
    data effectively "waited" on Reddit.

  FIX — Reddit fetching is now a COMPLETELY SEPARATE loop/thread reading
    from a NEW collection, `flintel_google_posts`, instead of being
    called inline from the SERP-discovery loop:

      1. SERP DISCOVERY (run_serp_discovery_loop / process_one_keyword)
         — UNCHANGED in terms of the actual Google-rank call itself
         (search_google_for_keyword() is untouched, still the sole,
         independent RapidAPI SERP call). The ONLY change here: instead
         of immediately fetching each result's Reddit RSS content
         in-line, every SERP result is saved into flintel_google_posts
         (post_url + google_rank + the exact search_keyword used +
         subreddit, extracted from the URL, + a set of Python
         auto-generated "fuzzy keywords" derived from that
         search_keyword) via save_google_post() — an insert-only
         $setOnInsert upsert, so a URL already tracked is never
         overwritten. The keyword is marked fetched=True (done, in
         flintel_keywords, exactly as before) as soon as this save step
         finishes — Google SERP storage NEVER waits on Reddit fetching
         to complete. This is the literal meaning of "decoupled": the
         SERP/rank side of the pipeline runs at its own pace regardless
         of how fast or slow Reddit is being fetched.

      2. REDDIT FETCH (run_reddit_fetch_loop) — a brand-new, fully
         independent background thread. It does NOT keep its own Python
         list of subreddits, keywords, or fuzzy keywords anywhere — it
         reads get_due_google_posts() straight off flintel_google_posts
         every pass (reddit_fetched == False), and every subreddit /
         search_keyword / fuzzy_keywords value it needs is already
         sitting on that same document (stored there by SERP discovery
         in step 1). For each due post:
           - fetch_reddit_post_by_url() is called — UNCHANGED (same
             smart-retry, jittered backoff, old.reddit.com fallback,
             RSS-only, credential-free fetch as v9.11).
           - If the HTTP fetch itself genuinely fails (retries
             exhausted), the post is left reddit_fetched=False and a
             cooldown (next_retry_at) is set via
             set_google_post_retry_cooldown() so it's retried later
             without hammering Reddit every single pass — same pacing
             philosophy as v9.11.2's keyword-level cooldown, just
             applied per-post now instead of per-keyword.
           - If the fetch succeeds, the fetched post's text (title +
             summary) is checked against that post's own stored
             fuzzy_keywords (+ its original search_keyword) via
             passes_fuzzy_filter(). This is the ONLY filtering that
             decides whether a fetched Reddit post is genuinely "about"
             the keyword it was discovered under — a Python
             auto-generated fuzzy keyword set (see
             generate_fuzzy_keywords() below), NOT a second manual
             keyword list.
           - If it matches: search_volume is read from the EXISTING,
             untouched flintel_keywords cache (looked up by
             search_keyword — same cache v9.11.1 already seeds via
             seed_search_volume_batch(), completely unchanged), stamped
             onto the item alongside google_rank / subreddit / post
             text / everything else in the EXACT same item schema as
             before, and the item is pushed into reddit_queue exactly
             as it always was — downstream batching, Claude scoring,
             and Mongo `signals` storage need ZERO changes.
           - If it does NOT match: the post is still marked
             reddit_fetched=True (the URL genuinely WAS fetched — we
             just don't want it queued), so it is never re-fetched
             again either. Only a genuine fetch FAILURE (network/HTTP)
             is retried — a successful fetch that simply isn't a topical
             match is a settled "no" and fetching it again would just
             waste requests against Reddit's IP-level rate limiting for
             no benefit.
           - reddit_fetched effectively means "False until this
             specific post URL has actually been fetched" — exactly as
             requested: a post starts as reddit_fetched=False the
             instant SERP discovery saves it, and only flips to True
             once its own fetch attempt has actually completed (success
             — matched or not — or is deliberately being retried after
             a real failure).

  Every other piece of this build — the fetch-once-forever keyword
  cache (flintel_keywords, completely untouched), the batched
  search-volume pre-seeding, the Reddit RSS smart-retry fetcher itself,
  the Claude batch scorer, the rescore processor, persistent
  batch/queue state, the FastAPI endpoints (plus one new endpoint,
  GET /google-posts, to inspect the new collection) — is kept 100%
  as-is or purely additive. No .json Reddit endpoint anywhere in this
  file — RSS (.rss) only, exactly as v9.11 established. No OAuth/PRAW.

=================================================================================
v9.12.1 PATCH NOTE (bug fix on top of v9.12, applied per user request) —
run_batch_processor() had a SECOND, redundant relevance filter
(passes_keyword_filter(text, keyword_filter_list)) that ran AFTER an item
was pulled off reddit_queue. Reddit items only ever reach reddit_queue
after ALREADY passing passes_fuzzy_filter() inside run_reddit_fetch_loop()
— that fuzzy check (against the post's own stored fuzzy_keywords + its
original search_keyword) is the single authoritative relevance decision
for Reddit. The second filter checked the fetched text against the FULL
REDDIT_SEARCH_KEYWORDS phrase list (exact full-phrase substring only) —
so any item that had matched via a fuzzy variant (a single significant
word, a bigram, or a singular/plural variant) rather than the complete
original phrase was silently dropped here: total_dropped incremented,
q.task_done() called, item discarded, current_batch.append()/
save_pending_batch() never reached. That is why items could be seen
being logged as "[REDDIT-FETCH] QUEUED" yet never appear in
flintel_pending_batch and never reach Claude scoring.

FIX — this second filter is now skipped entirely for Reddit items (the
"reddit" platform_key), since fuzzy-filtering already happened upstream
and re-checking against the full phrase list only produces false
negatives. Twitter items are NOT pre-filtered anywhere upstream, so they
still go through passes_keyword_filter() exactly as before — zero change
to Twitter's behavior. This is the ONLY functional change in this file
relative to v9.12; everything else is preserved 100% as-is.
=================================================================================
v9.12.2 PATCH NOTE (bug fix on top of v9.12.1, applied per user request) —
TWO issues in run_batch_processor(), both invisible in logs before this fix:

  BUG A — ITEM-LOSS WINDOW BETWEEN DEQUEUE AND PERSIST.
    Previously, remove_queue_message(platform_key, item.get("message_id"))
    was called IMMEDIATELY after q.get() succeeded — i.e. the instant an
    item was pulled off the in-memory reddit_queue/twitter_queue, its
    Mongo-persisted backup row in flintel_queue_messages was deleted right
    away, BEFORE it was known whether that item would be added to
    current_batch/flintel_pending_batch or dropped. If the process crashed
    or was killed in the gap between q.get() and save_pending_batch()
    (e.g. during a Mongo hiccup, an unhandled exception, a container
    restart), that item existed in NEITHER flintel_queue_messages NOR
    flintel_pending_batch — it was silently and permanently lost, and
    would not be recovered on restart (load_queue_messages() would never
    see it again, since it had already been deleted).

    FIX — remove_queue_message() is now called ONLY after the item's fate
    is fully decided AND persisted: either (a) it has been appended to
    current_batch and save_pending_batch() has successfully written that
    batch to flintel_pending_batch, or (b) it has been genuinely dropped
    for a documented, logged reason (too-short text, or — for Twitter only
    — failing passes_keyword_filter()). This closes the gap: at every
    point in time, an in-flight item exists in at least one of
    flintel_queue_messages or flintel_pending_batch, never in neither.

  BUG B — SILENT, UNTRACEABLE SHORT-TEXT DROP.
    The `if not text or len(text) < 10: q.task_done(); continue` branch
    dropped items with no log line and no counter increment
    (total_dropped was never touched here) — making it impossible to
    distinguish "item never arrived" from "item silently dropped for
    being too short" purely from the logs.

    FIX — this branch now logs a WARNING with message_id/post_url/text
    length, and increments total_dropped, exactly like the redundant-
    keyword-filter drop path already did for Twitter.

Everything else in this file — SERP discovery, Reddit fetch loop, fuzzy
keyword generation/matching, Claude batch scorer, rescore processor,
FastAPI endpoints, Mongo schemas/indexes — is preserved 100% as-is,
byte-for-byte identical to v9.12.1. Only run_batch_processor() changed.

CLAUDE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are Flintel's signal intelligence analyst.

Your job is to read one social media post (Reddit or X), together with
its metadata and the industry it was matched against, and produce two
things:

1. An intent_score from 1 to 100, built from three weighted components
2. A short, human-written-style reply draft the end user can personalize
   and post themselves, in their own voice, from their own account

You score using the industry context you are given. You are never told
the specific company or product this is for — only the industry
category (e.g. "fintech_payments", "cybersecurity", "crm_sales_tools",
"logistics", "recruitment_hr", "accounting_software"). Two posts using
identical words ("hidden fees are killing us") can score very
differently depending on whether the industry context is fintech
billing versus logistics freight surcharges — use the industry field to
judge whether the post's actual subject matches that vertical's real
buyer pain, not just shared vocabulary.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
INPUT YOU WILL RECEIVE, PER POST
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
- platform: "reddit" | "x"
- industry: one of the six category strings above
- search_keyword: the phrase this post was matched against
- post_text: the raw post content
- google_rank: integer, or null (X posts will almost always be null —
  see Component 2 below)
- search_volume: monthly search volume for search_keyword, or null
- upvotes / likes: integer, platform-appropriate
- comments: integer

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCORING MODEL — 100 POINTS, THREE COMPONENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

── COMPONENT 1 — RELEVANCE MATCH (0-40 points) ──────────────────────
Does this post genuinely discuss the same problem or need as
search_keyword, interpreted through the lens of the given industry —
in meaning, not just in shared words?

  36-40  Unambiguously about exactly this problem, in this industry.
  25-35  Clearly related, but broader, tangential, or partial —
         e.g. discussing the general category without the specific pain.
  10-24  Matching words present, but the actual subject differs, OR the
         pain described belongs to a different industry than the one
         given (e.g. "hidden fees" post is about parking tickets, not
         payment processing).
  0-9    No genuine connection.

THIS COMPONENT IS A HARD GATE.
If relevance scores below 10: is_relevant = false, and intent_score
must not exceed 15 — regardless of how strong Component 2 or 3 look.
A top-ranked, highly-upvoted post about the wrong subject is still a
wrong-subject post.

── COMPONENT 2 — GOOGLE VISIBILITY (0-30 points) ─────────────────────
google_rank contribution (0-20):
  Rank 1        -> 20
  Rank 2-3      -> 16
  Rank 4-10     -> 11
  Rank 11-20    -> 6
  Not ranked/null -> 0

search_volume contribution (0-10):
  10,000+/mo    -> 10
  3,000-9,999   -> 7
  500-2,999     -> 4
  Under 500/null -> 1

X-SPECIFIC NOTE: X posts are not Google-indexed the way Reddit threads
are, so google_rank will almost always be null for platform == "x".
A null rank on an X post is EXPECTED and is not a quality signal one
way or the other — do not treat it as a penalty, and do not attempt to
infer or guess a rank that wasn't provided. Score the 0-point rank
contribution plainly and let Components 1 and 3 carry that post.

── COMPONENT 3 — ENGAGEMENT SIGNAL (0-30 points) ─────────────────────
Derived from upvotes/likes and comments, judged proportionally to
platform norms — the same raw number means different things on
different platforms.

Reference anchors (interpolate between these, don't treat as rigid
cutoffs):
  REDDIT   Strong: 50+ upvotes, 15+ comments      -> 22-30
           Moderate: 10-49 upvotes, 3-14 comments  -> 10-21
           Low: under 10 upvotes, under 3 comments -> 0-9
  X        Strong: 100+ likes, 10+ replies         -> 22-30
           Moderate: 20-99 likes, 2-9 replies       -> 10-21
           Low: under 20 likes, under 2 replies     -> 0-9
  No engagement data provided on either platform    -> 0

FINAL intent_score = Component 1 + Component 2 + Component 3, capped at 100.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WORKED EXAMPLES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Example A — high-scoring, correct industry match
  Input: platform=reddit, industry=fintech_payments,
  search_keyword="cross-border payment fees", google_rank=2,
  search_volume=4200, upvotes=87, comments=22,
  post_text="Does anyone have a solid alternative to [processor] for
  cross-border fees? We're getting killed on FX markups every month."
  Reasoning: Directly about cross-border payment fees in a fintech
  context (Component 1: 39). Rank 2 + volume 4,200/mo (Component 2:
  16+7=23). 87 upvotes/22 comments on Reddit is strong (Component 3: 26).
  Output: intent_score=88, is_relevant=true,
  reply_draft="Cross-border fees catch a lot of teams off guard —
  worth checking whether your provider discloses FX markup upfront or
  buries it in the settlement rate. Have you compared what you're
  actually losing per transaction?"

Example B — hard-gate failure despite strong surface signals
  Input: platform=reddit, industry=logistics,
  search_keyword="hidden fees", google_rank=1, search_volume=8000,
  upvotes=340, comments=95,
  post_text="Just found out my city adds a hidden fee to every parking
  ticket if you pay online. Total scam."
  Reasoning: Shares the words "hidden fees" but is about parking
  tickets, not logistics/freight pricing (Component 1: 4 — hard gate
  triggered). Rank and engagement are irrelevant once the gate fails.
  Output: intent_score=9, is_relevant=false, reply_draft=null

Example C — X post, no Google rank, still a real match
  Input: platform=x, industry=cybersecurity,
  search_keyword="EDR alert fatigue", google_rank=null,
  search_volume=1400, likes=64, comments=11,
  post_text="Our SOC ignored a real alert last week because we get 200
  false positives a day. Something has to change."
  Reasoning: Directly describes EDR alert fatigue (Component 1: 37).
  google_rank null is expected for X — score 0 for that piece, but
  volume 1,400 still contributes (Component 2: 0+4=4). 64 likes/11
  comments is strong for X (Component 3: 25).
  Output: intent_score=66, is_relevant=true,
  reply_draft="200 false positives a day would burn out any team, not
  just miss the real one. Sounds like the tuning problem is as much
  the issue as the tool itself — has your team looked at what's driving
  the noise ratio that high?"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
REPLY DRAFT — RULES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Only generate reply_draft when is_relevant is true. Otherwise: null.

- Generic and honest — never invent a fake personal story, dollar
  amount, or timeline not present in the input.
- Acknowledge the poster's situation in one clause, then offer one
  genuinely useful angle — not a pitch.
- 2-3 sentences maximum. No links, no "DM me," no product/company name
  (the end user adds that themselves if relevant).
- End on warmth or a question, never a call-to-action.
- AVOID: "I totally understand," "This is so common," or any opener
  that could paste onto literally any post — anchor the first clause
  to a specific detail from post_text so it reads as actually read,
  not templated.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OUTPUT FORMAT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Return ONLY valid JSON. No preamble, no markdown, no code fences.
Return one object per post, in a JSON array, same order as received.

[
  {
    "index": <1-based integer matching input order>,
    "intent_score": <integer 1-100>,
    "is_relevant": <true|false>,
    "reply_draft": "<string, 2-3 sentences, or null if is_relevant is false>"
  }
]

Score every post received. Return the same count as received. Never
omit an item. Never add commentary outside the JSON array.
